== Description ==

You've setup a WordPress site and turned it into a Social Network using WP Symposium, but the blog part of your site is important to you as well? WP Symposium Blog Post is the perfect addition to your WP/WPS site.

WP Symposium Blog Post plugin integrates WP Symposium with your WordPress blog, by:

* Adding a new menu item to your authors' WPS Profile page to list their posts, and link to them.
* Conversely, adding a link on your authors' blog posts to their WPS Profile page.
* Adding one row to their WPS Activity each time they publish a post in the blog.
* Adding one row to members' WPS Activity each time they comment on a post or a page.

NB: this plugin requires WP Symposium to run. You need to activate at the minimum both the core module and the Profile module of WP Symposium to use this plugin.

== Installation ==

= Installing the plugin =

Use the WordPress feature to install the plugin from the WP Dashboard, Plugins > Add New.

Alternatively, download the ZIP file from wordpress.org, extract its content and upload the folder wp-symposium-blogpost via FTP in your path-to/wp-content/plugins folder.

A WP Symposium Blog Post plugin should then be available through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, so that you activate the plugin.

= Upgrading the plugin =

Use the WordPress feature to upgrade the plugin from the WP Dashboard.  This process will automatically de-activate and re-activate the plugin.

Alternatively, download the zip file and extract its content locally. Deactivate the previous version to avoid any warning due to changes, and upload the folder wp-symposium-blogpost via FTP in your path-to/wp-content/plugins folder.  Re-activate the plugin.

= Configuring the plugin for your site =

A new menu item will appear in the WP Dashboard, under "WP Symposium" and called "Blog Posts", where you will find options for the plugin.

If you haven't done so already, create a WP page that will hold members' profile information. It must contain one of the available shortcodes for the WPS Profile page, which can also be the shortcode for blog posts. The shortcode you are using for this page will set the default display for this WPS Profile page. It isn't important that you create a page dedicated to blog posts, those will appear as menu items at the profile page anyway.

If you are using WP Symposium Profile page with a horizontal menu, at the dashboard WPS Profile Options page, new menu items will appear at the bottom of the WPS Profile page structures, called "My Blog Posts" on own WP Symposium Profile page, and "Blog Posts" on others' profile. The corresponding menu items "My Blog Posts" and "Blog Post" will be displayed at the WPS Profile page, as per the menu structure. It is advised that you check that the blog post menu items fit in your menu structure, especially with regards to roles and to avoid empty submenus for roles not checked at the WPS Blog Post options page.

If you are using WP Symposium Profile page with a vertical menu, a new menu item on the Profile page will be called "My Blog Posts" on own WP Symposium Profile page, "Blog Posts" on others' profile. You don't need to do anything else here.

= Customizations =

The file developers.txt, located in the plugin folder, details the available hooks for this plugin, as well as its CSS classes. This also explain how to customize the default display of the plugin, like for instance: display custom post types, add anything to posts rows, display posts by rows of two, three, etc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Can I use Blog Post without WP Symposium?

No, you can't, this plugin requires WP Symposium as it'll reside within this plugin

* Can I customize WPS Blog Post?

Yes, have a look at developers.txt, in the zipped package, it explains how you can use hooks and CSS styles.

== Screenshots ==

Important! Due to a plugin filename change, you will need to manually re-activate the plugin after this upgrade. For those of you who upgrade manually via FTP, make sure you remove completely the plugin via FTP before reuploading it, to avoid duplicated entries in the plugin management dashboard.

Updated as per WP Symposium v13.04. This (somehow) long awaited update of the plugin will add the following features:

* Upon plugin activation, automatically add a blog posts menu item to the WPS Profile page horizontal menu
* Blog posts comments authors can be automatically URL'ed with their members' WPS Profile page if they are registrered on the site
* Comments can be added to activity, for posts and pages, as well as any custom post types defined on your WP site

In addition, it also corrects the following issues:

* Make use of get_permalink() so that posts permalinks are consistent with WP Permalinks settings
* Restore the option to direct the author's links to the WPS profile page blog posts, which had stopped working due to WPS internal changes
* Correct the wrapper name in the plugin CSS file

NB: I'm switching to a more standard way of incrementing version numbers. As of now,

* First digit will tag major updates with significant additions in functionalities
* Second digit will be used for minor updates and bug fixes
* Third digit will tag only beta versions and work-in-progress

Fix the link generated on post metainfo to author's WPS Profile page:
